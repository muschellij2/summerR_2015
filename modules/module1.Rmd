## What is R?

- R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics

- R is the open source implementation of the S language, which was developed by Bell laboratories

- R is both open source and open development

(source: http://www.r-project.org/)

## Why R?

* Powerful and flexible

* Free (open source)

* Extensive add-on software (packages)

* Designed for statistical computing

* High level language

## Why not R?

* Fairly steep learning curve

    * "Programming" oriented
    
    * Minimal interface
    
* Little centralized support, relies on online community and package developers

* Annoying to update

* Slower, and more memory intensive, than the more traditional programming languages (C, Java, Perl, Python)

## Installing R

Install the latest version from: [http://cran.r-project.org/](http://cran.r-project.org/ )

If you have an older version of R, you may not need to update.  If you do want to update, re-install and run

<b>
```{r, eval=FALSE}
update.packages(ask=FALSE)
```
</b>

## R Studio

(Makes R easier)

* Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for R
    * Syntax highlighting, code completion, and smart indentation
    * Execute R code directly from the source editor
    * Easily manage multiple working directories using projects
    * Workspace browser and data viewer
    * Plot history, zooming, and flexible image and PDF export
    * Integrated R help and documentation
    * Searchable command history

## Working with R
* The R Console "interprets" whatever you type
    * Calculator
    * Creating variables
    * Applying functions
* "Analysis" Script + Interactive Exploration
    * Static copy of what you did (reproducability)
    * Try things out interactively, then add to your script
* R revolves around functions
    * Commands that take input, performs computations, and returns results
    * Many come with R, but people write external functions you can download and use

## Useful R Studio Shortcuts

* `Ctrl + Enter` (`Cmd + Enter` on OS X) in your script evaluates that line of code
    * It's like copying and pasting the code into the console for it to run.
* `Ctrl+1` takes you to the script page
* `Ctrl+2` takes you to the console
